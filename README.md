# Wind-Turbines-US-Analysis
Python, Tableau

This project, developed by a group of 4 contributors, provides key insights and analysis of Wind Turbine manufacturers and their market dynamics. The aim is to understand the market share, retrofitting activities, and the overall growth of the industry. The analysis focuses on major manufacturers and their performance metrics, providing valuable information for stakeholders and industry enthusiasts. The project follows an Agile workflow and utilizes Trello for task management and collaboration.

Market Share

The project provides an in-depth analysis of Wind Turbine manufacturers' market share. It highlights the top three manufacturers, namely GE Wind, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa, and their respective market shares. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the industry's competitive landscape.

Retrofitting Activity

The retrofitting activity of Wind Turbine manufacturers is examined, focusing on the number of retrofits conducted per year. The analysis delves into the retrofit trends and their potential implications on the manufacturers' operations. It aims to shed light on the proactive approach adopted by certain manufacturers, such as GE Wind, in maintaining and upgrading their windmills.

Number of Wind Turbines

This section presents the growth trajectory of the Wind Turbine industry by examining the number of windmills installed over time. It provides a visual representation of the consistent growth in installations across major manufacturers. An interesting dip in 2013 is also discussed, offering insights into the industry's overall expansion and fluctuations.

Recommended Operators and Manufacturers

The project recommends Wind Turbine manufacturers for specific operators based on their requirements and preferences. Two operators, MidAmerican Energy, and RWE Renewables, are analyzed in terms of their preferred manufacturers. The evaluation considers factors such as turbine-rated capacity and recognized quality, resulting in the recommendation of both GE Wind and Siemens Gamesa for further investigation.
